In my webpage i've provided with a example mongodb url for authentication and authorisation purpose and have not used environment variables.

here you can first fork this repository in your local code editor, and follow the following steps:
1) cd backend
2) npm install  ( to install the dependencies)
3) npm start  (This will start the server on your local computer and make sure you don't have a previous server running on port 3000)
4) cd ../frontend
5) npm install  (to install the dependencies)
6) npm run dev (this will start rendering the page on your local host)
Now your project will run on the ports on your local computer server.




In this project i've used React.js, express, mongodb for database, tailwindcss for styling.
